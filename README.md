# Battle Machines

A Spigot plugin made for the 2016 Devathon.

Ride around massive battle machines to fight it out with your opponents.

### How to use
When you log in you will be placed in your battle machine.
You can look around to move around and your machine will automatically shoot.

It works better if you find a flat area.

Also, don't forget to check it out in 3rd person!

If you die or exit your battle machine you can get a new one by doing /bmachines.

If there are offset issues with your machine (like arrows firing lower than the guns), getting out of your machine (sneak), standing on the ground and doing /bmachines again should fix them.

If you feel so inclined, you can also create your own parts for the battle machines, although that is a bit more involved, so contact me if you want me to go through that with you.
