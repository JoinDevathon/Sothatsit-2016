# Battle Machines

A Spigot plugin made for the 2016 Devathon.

Ride around massive battle machines to fight it out with your opponents.

### How to use
When you log in you will be placed in your battle machine. You can look around to move around.

If you die or exit your battle machine you can get a new one by doing /bmachines.

If you feel so inclined, you can also create your own parts for the battle machines, although that is a bit more involved, so contact me if you want me to go through that with you.
